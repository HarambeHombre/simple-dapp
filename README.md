# Simple Dapp

This repository contains a simple decentralized application (Dapp) built with a Solidity smart contract and a Next.js frontend. It serves as a basic example of a full-stack web3 application.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main parts:

-   `blockchain/`: Contains the Solidity smart contract.
-   `site/`: Contains the Next.js frontend application.

## Technologies Used

-   **Blockchain**: Solidity
-   **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
-   **Web3 Integration**: wagmi, viem

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn)
-   A wallet provider like MetaMask

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HarambeHombre/simple-dapp.git
    cd simple-dapp
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd site
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through your web browser. Ensure your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) is connected to the appropriate network to interact with the smart contract functionalities.
